<h2>What is Pollled?</h2>

Pollled is an exciting and developing social innovation project by Sizr Studios. It is the ultimate polling solution packed with statistics, data and reports! It is developed on Ruby on Rails 3.2 and has been tested by beta testers over a period of one month. With developers at Sizr being a part of the very few on the PRO Rails Community in India, huge amount of time has been spent on the optimization and security of data. Pollled uses a single shot, custom solution based on OmniAuth/Devise for authentication. Pollled is OS and Device independent. It is simple and flexible.<br/><br/><br/>
